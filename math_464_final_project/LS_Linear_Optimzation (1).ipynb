The company necessarily has a vested interest in finding delivery routes that are not only efficient (short) but robust (not likely to incur delays).

        "In conclusion, our experiments reveal that in real-life scenarios, the distances between cities remain constant, indicating that alfa is always equal to 1. By running a loop for beta within the range of [0, 1], we observe a transition in the optimal path from \"A → D → B → O\" to \"A → D → E → O\" as beta increases from 0.1 to 0.3. To gain deeper insights into the range of beta values where the optimal path changes, we conduct a secondary loop within the range of [0.1, 0.3] with a step size of 0.01.\n",
        "Our research indicates that this transition occurs between beta = 0.25 and beta = 0.26. At beta = 0.25, the optimal path is \"A → D → B → O\" with a total distance of 75.0 miles and a delay likelihood of 0.013143. However, at beta = 0.26, the optimal path shifts to \"A → D → E → O\" with a total distance of 96.0 miles and a delay likelihood of 0.003904.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, the choice between these two options rests on the company's resources. Opting for a shorter travel distance of 75 miles may result in a higher delay likelihood of 0.013143 (meaning 1.3 % chance of having delay), whereas selecting the longer route of 96 miles offers a lower delay likelihood of 0.003904 ( meaning 0.3 % chance of having delay). The decision should be made considering the company's financial resources and the trade-off between travel distance and delay likelihood."
